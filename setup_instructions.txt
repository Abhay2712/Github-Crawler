2--> keep the csv file in the data folder
3--> setup the github token as environment variable to use github functions

4--> to run type the command in following format----------- node index.js -i file_name dependency@version -update (-update is  optional)
Eg. node index.js -i github_repos.csv axios@^0.23.0 -update
